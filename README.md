Mechanical design and technical drawing of a citrus juicer using SolidWorks

## Project Overview
This project involves the 3D modeling and assembly design of a manually operated citrus juicer using SolidWorks. The focus was on mechanical functionality, assembly structure, and preparation of engineering drawings.

## Design Scope
- Individual part modeling
- Full assembly creation (.SLDASM)
- Application of mechanical mates and constraints
- Generation of detailed technical drawings

## Engineering Considerations
- Load transfer through pressing mechanism
- Structural stability of supporting components
- Assembly alignment and constraint definition
- Basic manufacturability considerations

## CAD Workflow
- Part modeling in SolidWorks
- Assembly integration using mates
- Creation of 2D technical drawings
- Dimensioning according to engineering standards

## Tools Used
- SolidWorks (Part Design & Assembly)

## Repository Structure
- cad/ → Assembly file (.SLDASM)
- drawings/ → Technical drawings
- presentation/ → Project presentation

## Conclusion
This project enhanced practical skills in CAD modeling, mechanical assembly design, and engineering documentation preparation.
